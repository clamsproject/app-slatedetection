The current slate detection model has been applied to 40 videos and the results reviewed by gbh. Slates were only detected in 8 of the 40 videos. All of the videos had slates however some of the slates are handwritten. Over this collection the current model has 100% precision, 20% recall, 60% fmeasure. The next step is to test with varying thresholds and look at the roc curve to determine a good default threshold. We may also decide to retrain with more or different data.
